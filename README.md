# Finding-error-point-in-given-dataset-
A data-set of 100 points are given out of which 99 points satisfies given function, one doesn't

To find that one single point

Functions are:

Ques 1  y = (sin(ax+b))^2

Ques 2  y = exp(ax+b)

Ques 3 y = 1 / (ax +b) 

where a,b are parameters and x,y are variables.
